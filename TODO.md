# TODO

## Next steps:
- Set up monitoring and logging: http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/deploy.html
- Set up multiple instances... See how much memory they use.

## Before deploying:
- Detect face etc.
- https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/01/29/productionizing-a-flask-application/
- Find out how to route / dns stuff: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-ec2-instance.html

## Nice to have:
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Access-Control-Allow-Origin
- Rate limit
- Automatically load latest compressed model from S3
